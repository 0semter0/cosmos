# COSMOS
## an internet of blockchains

1. A Cosmos zone is a distributed ledger (blockchain).  Each zone can have
   differing transaction logic and policies.

2. We've developed a trick that allows zones to communicate with each other
   directly.  It's based on classical BFT algorithms, like Tendermint.
