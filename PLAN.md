Gnuclear Crowdfund Plan
-----------------------

DATE: July 5th, 2016
NOTE: The details in this plan override what is currently in the whitepaper.

* There will be a single crowdsale to sell 80% of quarks of 20M total.

* The proceeds of the crowdsale will go to the Foundation.

* The Foundation will be a Switzerland non-profit foundation.

* The crowdsale will be a simple Ethereum-style crowdsale occuring over 42 days.

* The crowdsale will happen over Bitcoin, on a multisig address controlled by
  the Foundation.  If the Ethereum hard-fork succeeds, we may split the
crowdsale between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

* The minimum raise amount will be $3M equivalent.  If the crowdsale sells less
  than $3M, 95% of the funds will be returned.

* Upon completion of the crowdsale, the Foundation will sell 50% of the raised
  amount and hold fiat in a Switzerland bank account.

* Some time after the crowdsale, an Ethereum contract (that holds no value) will
  determine the genesis 100 validators by allowing stakeholders to delegate.
There will be additional safety measures to mitigate risk of private key theft.
This contract is called the DelegationGame.

* The Foundation will designate an external for-profit legal entity to develop
  the software.  This entity is called the Contractor.

* Upon completion of the crowdsale, the Foundation will award $3M (half in fiat,
  half in bitcoins) to the Contractor to develop the software.

* The Foundation will construct a plan for what to do with the remaining
  crowdsale funds, if any.
