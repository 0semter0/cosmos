Atom Crowdfund Plan #2
----------------------

DATE: July 18th, 2016
NOTE: The details in this plan override what is currently in the whitepaper.

* The Atom Foundation will be a Canadian corporation.  Its purpose is to create,
  maintain, and further develop, the Atom Ecosystem.

* Some Early Funders will provide the Atom Foundation with $0.5M of capital to
  develop the Essential Atom Software.

* After the Essential Atom Software is developed, there will be a Crowdfunding
  campaign to sell tokens called "atoms" that give the holder limited license to
use the Atom Ecosystem.

* The proceeds of the Crowdfunding campaign will be used to develop the
  Complementary Atom Software and Services, controlled by the Atom Foundation.

* The remaining proceeds of the Crowdfund go to the Atom Reserve, controlled by
  the Atom Foundation.

* The Atom Foundation will employ a milestone-based or time-based vesting system
  to award Contractors to develop software or perform services.

* On Genesis, the distribution of atoms is split between:
  * the Contractors Bounty Pool (15%)
  * the Atom Foundation (5%)
  * the Early Funders (10%)
  * the Crowdfund (70%)

* In addition, 25% of the total number of atoms on Genesis (a constant
  predetermined amount), will be inflated by the Atom Hub Block Reward every
year, to be distributed in proportion to the bonded atom holders.

## Definitions

**Atom Foundation**

* Education
* Long term sustainability
* Manage raised funds

**Atom Ecosystem**
**Atom Hub Block Reward**
**Atom Reserve**
**Bounty Pool**
**Contractors**
**Crowdfund**

**Early Funders**: The Early Funders are qualified investors, and bear the
burden of risk, for the benefit of the Crowdfunding campaign. The
Early Funders will collectively provide $0.5M at a $5M total atom valuation.
The proceeds will be used to develop the Essential Atom Software.

## Bounty Pool

The Essential Atom Software and Complementary Atom Software and Services are
developed by Contractors to earn atoms from the Bounty Pool.

### Essential Atom Software

* Beta release of TendermintCore with security review and fixes
* Alpha release of Atom hub and security review
  * Staking
  * Delegation
  * Governance
  * Basic Client

NOTE: The Essential Atom Software does not include any zones support.

### Complementary Atom Software and Services

* TendermintCore V2
* Beta release of Atom hub and security review
  * Zone Support
  * Atom Explorer Client
* Fast Exchange w/ client
* Bitcoin zone w/ client
* Bitcoin peg (2.5% rewards as bounty vesting over 4 years)
* Ethereum zone w/ client
* Ethereum peg (2.5% rewards as bounty vesting over 4 years)

## Funding

Funds will be raised by the Atom Foundation in 2 phases.

### Phase 1: the Prefund

* Who: registered investors
* When: immediately
* Why: to raise funds to complete development of Essential Atom Software.
* How: foundation sells 10% of the genesis atoms.
* How Much: $500K

### Phase 2: the Crowdfund

* Who: members of the public who want to be validators, or want atoms
* When: after the Essential Atom Software is complete
* Why: to distribute atoms to the public to ensure a decentralized system; to
  give the Atom Foundation a chance to raise some funds for maintenance
* How: Ethereum-style Sale with optional burn with nominally better rate.
  Followed by the Delegation Game.
* How Much: Uncapped

The Atom Foundation will construct a plan for what to do with the remaining
crowdfund funds, if any.

## Legal Considerations

It is criticial that the Crowdfund be done in a way that doesn't violate
securities laws in various jurisdictions.  For example, in Canada, we look to
the [Offering Memorandum
Exemption](http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/en/NewsEvents_nr_20151029_finalize-offering-memorandum-exemption.htm).
In addition, we will structure the Crowdfund to occur after the Essential Atom
Software is built, reducing Crowdfund funder risk.
