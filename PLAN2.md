Atom Crowdfund Plan
-----------------------

DATE: July 17th, 2016
NOTE: The details in this plan override what is currently in the whitepaper.

* Distribution of Atoms is split in equal quarters between:
  * Atom Foundation
  * Partners of Atom Foundation 
  * Initial Validators
  * The Public


* Atom Foundation will likely be a Canadian non-profit foundation.

* Atom Foundation will designate an external for-profit legal entity to develop
  the software.  This entity is called the Contractor. Most of the funds raised by The Foundation
  will be used to pay the Contractor.

* Partners of the Atom Foundation are those members of the industry with strong reputations who commit to building
out and maintaining a zone on Atom. Examples include major companies in the Bitcoin/Ethereum space.
The atoms they receive will vest according to some milestone based timeline overseen by the foundation.

* Funds will be raised by the Atom Foundation in 3 phases.

* Phase0
  * Who: registered investors
  * When: immediately
  * Why: to raise funds to complete development of Tendermint Core
  * How: foundation sells some fraction of its tokens via traditional investment contract
  * How Much: ~$250k for 5% of total distribution

* Phase1
  * Who: members of the public that want to be validators
  * When: after Tendermint Core is complete (~October)
  * Why: to determine initial validators and to raise funds to complete development of Atom
  * How: foundation conducts a manual auction on Bitcoin for ~100 validator spots using a 2-of-3 multisig. 
  The atoms sold are non-fungible and vest such that validators have to be active over an extended period of time to claim their atoms.
  * How Much: minimum price fixed at ~$3000. Expect to raise somewhere between $300k and $1M

* Phase2: 
  * Who: members of the public who want atoms
  * When: after Atom is complete 
  * Why: to distribute atoms to the public to ensure a decentralized system; to give the foundation a chance to raise some funds for maintenance
  * How: users are given option to either burn bitcoin or donate to the foundations bitcoin address. Burning will have a slightly better rate
  * How Much: in total we expect a few million dollars, but this cant be predicted and who knows how much will be burned and how much donated

* The Foundation will construct a plan for what to do with the remaining
  crowdsale funds, if any.
