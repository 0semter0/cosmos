* We need funds to get us through until mid November.  That's 14 weeks.  It will
  allow us to pay for expenses, like for PR and legal fees.

  * $10K by Sunday, Aug 7th, 10:00am PDT
  * $21K per week thereafter every Sunday 10:00am PDT, until total of $300K for
    5% on genesis day.
  * If we do not get paid in time, we may defer to another pre-funder for a
    portion or the remainder of the prefund.
  * The majority of the received funds will be used for PR and legal purposes by
    the Crowdfunding date.  We will share the expense reports for bills relating
to PR and legal.
  * If all of the $300K are received by September 15th, we will provide a 5%
    rebate.

* We need flexibility with regards to the inflation model and other aspects of
  WHITEPAPER.md, the Funding Milestones, and Timeline.  See
https://github.com/gnuclear/atom-whitepaper/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md and
https://github.com/gnuclear/atom-whitepaper/blob/master/PLAN.md . For example,
we may pursue an aggressively exponential inflation model, with custom
commission rates settable by each validator candidate.

* The name will change, likely to Cosmos.

* We will be responsible for promoting the Atom Crowdfund around the globe with
  our partners.

* The only way this will be called off is if we find that with a fair degree of
  certainty, what we're doing is illegal (an unlikely scenario).  Then, we will
reassess the situation.

* Our first order of business will be to talk to lawyers.  We need to do this
  ASAP.

* We cannot return any fees already received.
