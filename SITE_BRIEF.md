## A couple of paragraphs about your company

We're a small startup creating an ambitious project, to upgrade the
Bitcoin/blockchain/cryptocurrency/altcoins ecosystem with exciting new
technology.

We started in 2014 with Tendermint (see tendermint.com).  Tendermint is an
open-source, and free blockchain consensus engine.  Instead of using
proof-of-work mining as in Bitcoin to secure the ledger, we use public-private
key cryptography and "classical" BFT algorithms.  Tendermint is much faster,
much more energy efficient, and more secure.  In addition, it lets us scale
blockchains horizontally without compromising on security.

Cosmos is a network of independent parallel blockchains that are each powered by
Tendermint.  This is what the website is about.  First we'll start out by
building the Cosmos Hub.  The Hub connects to many other blockchains (called
zones) via a novel inter-blockchain communication protocol.  The Hub tracks any
number of different token types, and keeps track of the total number of tokens
in each connected zone.  This architecture solves so many problems that the
blockchain space faces today, including application interoperability,
scalability, seamless upgradability, and even secure distributed exchanges.

Cosmos is not just a single distributed ledger, and the Cosmos hub isn't a
walled garden or the center of its universe.  We are designing a protocol for a
network of distributed legers that can serve as a new foundation for our future
financial system, based on the principles of cryptography, robust theory,
transparency, and accountability.

## The products your sell or services you provide

We are crowdfunding for a public blockchain.  We create free and open software
and design distributed protocols.  The service that Cosmos provides is the
accounting of virtual tokens/coins.

## The size of the company – e.g. the number of employees, a rough turnover figure

3 employees and a budding community

## Are you an international company? If so, which countries?

The founders are from the US and Canada, but our supporters are global.

## How long have you been established?

The Tendermint project started in 2014.  The Cosmos project is brand spanking
new.

## Describe the company using five or ten words

Ambitious, computer-science, crypto-economic, game-theoretic, ambitious,
inevitable, internet-of-money, ambitious

## Outline the aims of the website

* raise awareness of Cosmos - overview of what it's about to pique interest
* announce our Crowdsale coming up in early October, with countdown timer & date
* stay minimal

## Who is the target audience?

Bitcoiners, cryptocurrency folk, financiers, open-source programmers, Bitcoin
miners, libertarians, crypto-anarchists, trans-humanists, crypto speculators,
computer-scientists, activists

## How will your target audience be accessing your site – via their phones, tablets or desktops?

Phones, Laptops

## Is the new website part of a re-brand, or a new product launch?

Yes, this is a new product launch

## Is there other advertising taking place that the new website should tie in with?

Yes, there will be a Reddit community, Bitcointalk community, Slack community,
and a Twitter account.  We also want to collect emails for a newsletter

## What are the unique selling points for your company, your products or your services?

We have a good reputation for having created good technology with solid theory.

## Is the market already saturated with competitors?

Maybe.  Lisk, Rootstock, Ethereum, Blockstream ... though none strictly compete
with us for the Cosmos vision.  Another aspect of Cosmos is that like the
internet, it's about interconnectness and cooperation under a common protocol,
so in the future our competition will tie into our network as well.

## List a few competitors’ websites.

Again, these aren't actually competitors, but they're in our space.

## Budget

$1500 for exploring sketch/mockup/wireframe, more to implement, more for copy.
Total budget is ~ $10K
