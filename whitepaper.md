# GnuClear: A New Architecture for Scalable Blockchain Decentralization

Jae Kwon jae@tendermint.com
Ethan Buchman ethan@tendermint.com

The combined success of the open-source ecosystem, of decentralized
file-sharing, and of public cryptocurrencies, has inspired an understanding that
decentralized internet protocols can be used to radically improve socio-economic
infrastructure.  We have seen specialized blockchain applications like Bitcoin
(a cryptocurrency), Namecoin (a name registry), ZCash (a cryptocurrency for
privacy); and also generalized smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, with
countless distributed applications for the EVM such as Augur (a prediction
market) and TheDAO (an investment club).

To date, however, these blockchains have suffered from a number of drawbacks,
including their gross energy inefficiency, poor or limited performance, and
immature governance mechanisms.  A number of proposals have been made to scale
Bitcoin's transaction throughput such as Segregated-Witness and BitcoinNG, but
these are vertical scaling solutions that remain limited by the capacity of a
single physical machine, lest we sacrifice the property of complete
auditability.  Lightning networks can help scale Bitcoin transaction volume by
leaving some transactions off the ledger completely, but are mostly suited for
micropayments as significant capital is required to be locked up.

An ideal solution would be one that allows multiple parallel blockchains to
interoperate while retaining their security properties, but this has proven
difficult, if not impossible, with proof-of-work. Merged-mining, for instance,
allows the work done to secure a parent chain to be re-used on a child chain,
but transactions still must be validated, in order, by each node, and a
merge-mined blockchain is vulnerable to attack if a majority of the hashing
power on the parent is not actively merge-mining the child.

Here we present GnuClear, a novel blockchain network architecture that addresses
all of these problems.  GnuClear is a network of many independent blockchains,
called shards, that are connected by a central blockchain, called the hub.  The
hub and shards are powered by Tendermint core, which provides a
high-performance, consistent, secure consensus engine, where strict
accountability guarantees hold over the behaviour of malicious actors.  The
GnuClear hub is a simple multi-asset proof-of-stake cryptocurrency with a simple
governance mechanism enabling the network to adapt and upgrade.  The hub and
shards of the GnuClear network communicate with each other via an
inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol which is formalized here.  The
GnuClear hub utilizes IBC packets to move coins from one shard to another while
maintaining the total amount of coins in the network, thus isolating each shard
from the failure of others.

We hope that the GnuClear network can prove once and for all that blockchain
based systems can scale as well as any other, and grow to become the foundation
for the future internet of blockchains.

## Related Work ################################################################

There have been many innovations in blockchain consensus and scalability in the
past couple of years.  This section provides a brief survey of a select number
of important ones.

### Classic Byzantine Fault Tolerance

Consensus in the presence of malicious participants is a problem dating back to
the early 80s, when Leslie Lamport coined the phrase "Byzantine fault" to refer
to arbitrary process behavior that deviates from the intended behavior, in
contrast to a "crash fault", wherein a process simply crashes.  Early solutions
were discovered for synchronous networks where there is an upper bound on
message latency, though pratical use was limited to highly controlled
environments such as airplane controllers and datacenters synchronized via
atomic clocks.  It was not until the late 90s that Practical Byzantine Fault
Tolerance (PBFT) was introduced as an efficient asynchronous consensus algorithm
able to tolerate up to â…“ of processes behaving arbitrarily.  PBFT became the
standard algorithm, spawning many variations, including most recently by IBM as
part of their contribution to Hyperledger.

The main benefit of Tendermint consensus over PBFT is that Tendermint has an
improved and simplified underlying structure, some of which is a result of
embracing the blockchain paradigm.  Tendermint blocks must commit in order,
which obviates the complexity and communication overhead associated with PBFT's
view-changes.  In addition, the batching of transactions into blocks allows for
regular Merkle-hashing of the application state, rather than periodic digests as
with PBFT's checkpointing scheme.  This allows for faster provable transaction
commits for light-clients, and as we'll later show, faster inter-blockchain
communication.

### Merged Mining

TODO insert summary and criticism of merged-mining

### BitShares delegated stake 

While not the first to deploy Proof-of-Stake (PoS), BitShares contributed
considerably to research and adoption of PoS blockchains, particularly those
known as "delegated" PoS.  In BitShares, stake holders elect "witnesses",
responsible for ordering and committing transactions, and "delegates",
responsible for co-ordinating software updates and parameter changes.  Though
BitShares achieves high performance (100k tx/s, 1s latency) in ideal conditions,
it is subject to double spend attacks by malicious witnesses which fork the
blockchain without suffering an explicit economic punishment -- it suffers from
the "nothing-at-stake" problem. BitShares attempts to mitigate the problem by
allowing transactions to refer to recent block hashes. Additionally,
stakeholders can remove or replace misbehaving witnesses on a daily basis,
though this does nothing to explicitly punish a double-spend attack that was
successful.

### Stellar 

Building on an approach pioneered by Ripple, Stellar refined a model of
Federated Byzantine Agreement wherein the processes participating in
consensus do not constitute a fixed and globally known set.  Rather, each
process node curates one or more "quorum slices" each constituting a set of
trusted processes. A "quorum" in Stellar is defined to be a set of nodes that
contain (is a superset of) at least one quorum slice for each node in the set,
such that agreement can be reached.

The security of the Stellar mechanism relies on the assumption that the
intersection of *any* two quorums is non-empty, while the availability of a node
requires at least one of its quorum slices to consist entirely of correct nodes,
creating a trade-off between using large or small quorum-slices that may be
difficult to balance without imposing significant assumptions about trust.
Ultimately, nodes must somehow choose adequate quorum slices for there to be
sufficient fault-tolerance (or any "intact nodes" at all, of which much of the
results of the paper depend on), and the only provided strategy for ensuring
such a configuration is heirarchical and similar to the Border Gateway Protocol
(BGP), used by top-tier ISPs on the internet to establish global routing tables,
and by that used by browsers to manage TLS certificates - both notorious for
their insecurity.

The criticism in the Stellar paper of the Tendermint-based proof-of-stake
systems is mitigated by the token strategy described here, wherein a new type of
token is issued that mostly represents the inherent value of the network,
without competing with any preexisting currency or store of value.  The
advantage of Tendermint-based proof-of-stake, then, is its relative simplicity,
while still providing sufficient, and provable security guarantees.

### BigchainDB

BigchainDB is a modification of the successful RethinkDB (a NoSQL datastore for
JSON-documents, with a query language) to include additional security guarantees
without sacrificing the ability to perform over a million transactions per
second. RethinkDB achieves this high performance with a combination of sharding
and replication, and utilizes the Raft consensus algorithm only for automatic
fail-over of replica "primaries" (leaders). RethinkDB does not currently provide
Byzantine fault-tolerance.

BigchainDB uses RethinkDB as the "underlying DB" to first order blocks, and adds
a layer of validator signatures on top to vote on the block's validity. A block
is considered valid and committed when a majority of the validators vote in
favor of it.  Making BigchainDB fully Byzantine fault-tolerant is a work in
progress.

### Lightning Network 

The lightning network is a proposed message relay network operating at a layer
above the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling many orders of magnitude improvement in
transaction throughput by moving the majority of transactions outside of the
consensus ledger into so-called "payment channels". This is made possible (with
great difficulty) by the Bitcoin scripting language, which enables parties to
enter into stateful contracts where the state can be updated by sharing digital
signatures, and contracts can be closed by finally publishing evidence onto the
blockchain, a mechanism first popularized by cross-chain atomic swaps.  By
openning payment channels with many parties, participants in the lightning
network can become focal points for routing the payments of others, leading to a
fully connected payment channel network, at the cost of much capital being tied
up on payment channels. 

While the lightning network can also easily extend across multiple independent
blockchains to allow for the transfer of _value_ via an exchange market, it
cannot be used to assymetrically transfer _coins_ from one blockchain to
another.  The main benefit of the GnuClear network described here is to enable
such direct coin transfers.

TODO also mention ILP here

### BitcoinNG

BitcoinNG is a proposed improvement to Bitcoin that would allow for forms of
vertical scalability, such as increasing the block size, without the negative
economic consequences typically associated with such a change, such as the
disproportionately large impact on small miners.  This improvement is achieved
by separating leader election from transaction broadcast: leaders are first
elected by Proof-of-Work in "micro-blocks", and then able to broadcast
transactions to be committed until a new micro-block is found. This reduces the
bandwidth requirements necessary to win the PoW race, allowing small miners to
more fairly compete, and allowing transactions to be committed more regularly by
the last miner to find a micro-block.

### Segregated Witness 

Segregated Witness is a Bitcoin improvement proposal
[link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) that aims
to increase the per-block tranasction throughput 2X or 3X, while simultaneously
making block syncing faster for new nodes.  The brilliance of this solution is
in how it works within the limitations of Bitcoin's current protocol and allows
for a soft-fork upgrade (i.e. clients with older versions of the software will
continue to function after the upgrade).  Tendermint being a new protocol has no
design restrictions, so it has a different scaling priorities.  Primarily,
Tendermint uses a BFT round-robin algorithm based on cryptographic signatures
instead of mining, which trivially allows horizontal scaling through multiple
parallel blockchains, while regular, more frequent block commits allow for
vertical scaling as well.

### Sidechains

Sidechains are a proposed mechanism for scaling the Bitcoin network via
alternative blockchains that are "pegged" to the Bitcoin blockchain.  Sidechains
allow bitcoins to effectively move from the Bitcoin blockchain to the sidechain
and back, and allow for experimentation in new features on the sidechain.  The
mechanism, known as a two-way peg, uses the standard Simple Payment Verification
(SPV) used by Bitcoin light clients, where proof of a sufficiently long chain of
block headers containing a particular transaction serves as evidence for the
existence of the transaction. Each chain in the peg serves as a light client of
the other, using SPV proofs to determine when coins should be transferred across
the peg and back.  Of course, since Bitcoin uses proof-of-work, Bitcoin
sidechains suffer from the many risks of proof-of-work as a consensus mechanism,
which are particularly exacerbated in a scalability context. That said, the core
mechanism of the two-way peg is in principle the same as that employed by the
GnuClear network, though using a consensus algorithm that scales more securely.

### Casper 

Casper is a proposed Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm for Ethereum.  Its prime
mode of operation is "consensus-by-bet".  The idea is that by letting validators
iteratively bet on which block it believes will become committed into the
blockchain based on the other bets that it's seen so far, finality can be
achieved eventually.
[link](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/12/28/understanding-serenity-part-2-casper/).
This is an active area of research by the Casper team.  The challenge is in
constructing a betting mechanism that can be proven to be an evolutionarily
stable strategy.  The main benefit of Casper as compared to Tendermint may be in
offering "availability over consistency" -- consensus does not require a +â…”
quorum from the validators -- perhaps at the cost of commit speed or
implementation complexity.

## Tendermint ##################################################################

In this section we describe the Tendermint consensus protocol and the interface
used to build applications with it.

### Consensus

A fault tolerant consensus protocol enables a set of non-faulty processes to
eventually agree on a value proposed by at least one of them.  The problem is
made more difficult by asynchronous network conditions, wherein messages may
have arbitrarily long delays, and by Byzantine faults, wherein processes may
exhibit arbitrary, possibly malicious, behaviour.  In particular, it is well
known that deterministic consensus in asynchronous networks is impossible
\cite{flp}, and that consensus protocols can tolerate strictly fewer Byzantine
faults than crash faults (â…“ of processes, vs. Â½). The former results from the
inability to distinguish crash failures from asynchronous message delay. The
latter from the fact that three processes are not enough for a safe majority
vote if one of them can lie (you need at least four).

In addition to providing optimal fault tolerance, a well designed consensus
protocol should provide additional guarantees in the event that the tolerance
capacity is exceeded and the consensus fails.  This is especially necessary in
public economic systems, where Byzantine behaviour can have substantial
financial reward.  The most important such guarantee is a form of
\emph{accountability}, where the processes that caused the consensus to fail can
be identified and punished according to the rules of the protocol, or, possibly,
the legal system.  When the legal system is unreliable, validators can be forced
to make security deposits in order to participate, and those deposits can be
revoked, or slashed, when malicious behaviour is detected \cite{slasher}.

Tendermint is a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol for
asynchronous networks, notable for its simplicity, performance, and
accountability.  The protocol requires a fixed, known set of N validators, where
the ith validator is identified by its public key, V_i. Validators attempt to
come to consensus on one block at a time, where a block is a list of
transactions.  Consensus on a block proceeds in rounds. Each round has a
round-leader, or proposer, who proposes a block. The validators then vote, in
stages, on whether or not to accept the proposed block or move onto the next
round.

We call the voting stages PreVote and PreCommit. A vote can be for a particular
block or for Nil.  We call a collection of +â…” PreVotes for a single block in the
same round a Polka, and a collection of +â…” PreCommits for a single block in the
same round a Commit.  If +â…” PreCommit for Nil in the same round, they move to
the next round. 

The proposer at round r is simply r mod N. Note that the strict determinism
incurs a weak synchrony assumption as faulty leaders must be detected and
skipped.  Thus, validators wait some amount TimeoutPropose before they Prevote
Nil.  Progression through the rest of the round is fully asychronous, in that
progress is only made once a validator hears from +â…” of the network.  

An additional set of constraints, or Locking Rules, ensure that the network will
eventually commit just one value. Any malicious attempt to cause more than one
value to be committed can be identified.  First, a PreCommit for a block must
come with justification, in the form of a Polka for that block. If the validator
has already PreCommit a block at round R_1, we say they are "locked" on that
block, and the Polka used to justify the new PreCommit at round R_2 must come in
a round R_polka where `R_1 < R_polka <= R_2`.  Second, validators must Propose
and/or PreVote the block they are "locked" on.  Together, these conditions
ensure that a validator does not PreCommit without sufficient evidence, and that
validators which have already PreCommit cannot contribute to evidence to
PreCommit something else.  This ensures both safety and liveness of the
consensus algorithm.

The full details of the protocol are described in FIGURE.

Tendermintâ€™s security derives simultaneously from its use of optimal Byzantine
fault-tolerance and the locking mechanism.  The former ensures that â…“ or more
validators must be Byzantine to cause a violation of safety, where more than two
values are committed.  The latter ensures that, if ever any set of validators
attempts, or even succeeds, in violating safety , they can be identified by the
protocol.  This includes both voting for conflicting blocks and broadcasting
unjustified votes.

Despite its strong guarantees, Tendermint provides exceptional performance.  In
benchmarks of 64 nodes distributed across 7 datacenters on 5 continents, on
commodity cloud instances, Tendermint consensus can process thousands of
transactions per second, with commit latencies on the order of one or two
seconds.  Notably, performance of well over a thousand transactions per second
is maintained even in harsh adversarial conditions, with validators crashing or
broadcasting maliciously crafted votes. See FIGURE for details.

### Light Clients

A major benefit of Tendermint's consensus algorithm is simplified light client
security, especially as compared to Proof-of-Work, and to protocols like Bitcoin
which have no global state.  Instead of syncing a chain of block headers and
verifying the proof of work, light clients, who are assumed to know all public
keys in the validator set, need only verify the +â…” PreCommits in the latest
block.  The need to sync all block headers is eliminated as the existence of an
alternative chain (a fork) means at least â…“ of validator's deposits can be
slashed.  Of course, since slashing requires that _someone_ detects the fork, it
would be prudent for light clients, or at least those that are able, to sync
headers, perhaps more slowly, on a risk adjusted basis, where the explicit cost
of a fork can be easily calculated at at least â…“ of the bonded stake.
Additionally, light clients must stay synced with changes to the validator set,
in order to avoid certain long range attacks (TODO: link to next section).

In a spirit similar to Ethereum, Tendermint enables applications to embed a
global Merkle root hash in each block, allowing easily verifiable state queries
for things like account balances, the value stored in a contract, or the
existence of an unspent transaction output, depending on the nature of the
application.

### Preventing Long Range Attacks

Assuming a sufficiently resilient collection of broadcast networks and a static
validator set, any fork in the blockchain can be detected and the deposits of
the offending validators slashed.  This innovation, first suggedt by Vitalik
Buterin in early 2014, solves the Nothing-at-Stake problem of other
Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies. However, since validator sets must be able to
change, over a long range of time the original validators may all become
unbonded, and hence would be free to create a new chain, from the genesis block,
incurring no cost as they no longer have deposits locked up.  This attack came
to be known as the Long Range Attack (LRA) in contrast to a Short Range Attack,
where validators who are currently bonded cause a fork and are hence punishable.
Long Range Attacks are often thought to be a critical blow to Proof-of-Stake.

Fortunately, the LRA can be mitigated as follows.  First, for a validator to
unbond, thereby recovering their deposit and no longer earning fees to
participate in the consensus, the deposit must be made unavailable for an amount
of time known as the "unbonding period", which may be on the order of weeks or
months.  Second, for a light client to be secure, the first time it connects to
the network it must verify a recent block hash against a trusted source, or
preferably multiple of them.  This condition is sometimes reffered to as "weak
subjectivity".  Finally, to remain secure, it must sync up with the latest
validator set at least as frequently as the length of the unbonding period. This
ensures that the light client knows about changes to the validator set before a
validator has its capital unbonded and thus no longer at stake, which would
allow it to deceive the client by carrying out a long range attack by creating
new blocks beginning back at a height where it was bonded (assuming it had
sufficient validating power then!).

Note that overcoming the LRA in this way requires a practical tweak of the
original security model of Proof-of-Work. In PoW, it is assumed that a light
client can sync to the current height from the trusted genesis block at any time
simply by processing the Proof-of-Work in every block header.  To overcome the
LRA, however, we require that a light client come online with some regularity,
and that the first time they come online they must be particularly careful to
authenticate what they hear from the network against trusted sources. Of course,
this latter requirement can be avoided if they are willing to sync all headers
from the genesis block, where the genesis block includes the original validator
set, and just like in Bitcoin, must be obtained from a trusted source.

### Overcoming Forks and Censorship Attacks

Due to the definition of a block commit, any â…“+ coalition of validators can
halt the blockchain by not broadcasting their votes. Such a coalition can also
censor particular transactions by rejecting blocks that include these
transactions, though this would result in a significant proportion of block
proposals to be rejected, which would slow down the rate of block commits of the
blockchain, reducing its utility and value. The malicious coalition might also
broadcast votes in a trickle so as to grind blockchain block commits to a near
halt, or engage in any combination of these attacks.  Finally, it can cause the
blockchain to fork, by double-signing or violating the locking rules.

If a global active adversary were also involved, it can partition the network
in such a way that it may appear that the wrong subset of validators were
responsible for the slowdown. This is not just a limitation of Tendermint, but
rather a limitation of all consensus protocols whose network is potentially
controlled by an active adversary.

For these types of attacks, a subset of the validators through means external to
the blockchain should coordinate to sign a reorg-proposal that chooses a fork
(and any evidence thereof) and the initial subset of validators with their
signatures. Clients should verify the signatures on the reorg-proposal, verify
any evidence, and make a judgement or prompt the end-user for a decision.
For example, a phone wallet app may prompt the user with a security warning,
while a refrigerator may accept any reorg-proposal signed by +Â½ of the
original validators. If we further require that validators who sign such a
reorg-proposal forego its collateral on all other forks, light-clients can be
assured by up to â…™ of the bonded collateral (â…™ == â…” - Â½). Notice that no
Byzantine fault tolerant algorithm can come to consensus when â…“+ of validators
are dishonest, yet a fork assumes that â…“+ of validators have been dishonest by
double-signing or lock-changing without justification. So, signing the reorg-
proposal is a coordination problem that cannot be solved internally by any
protocol -- not even Tendermint. It must be provided externally.

Assuming that the external coordination medium and protocol is robust, it
follows that forks are less of a concern than censorship attacks.

In addition to forks and censorship, which require â…“+ Byzantine validators, a
coalition of +â…” validators may commit arbitrary, invalid state.  This is
characteristic of any (BFT) consensus system. Unlike double-signing, which
creates forks with easily verifiable evidence, detecting committment of an
invalid state requires non-validating peers to verify whole blocks, which
implies that they keep a local copy of the state and execute each transaction,
computing the state root independently for themselves.  Once detected, the only
way to handle such a failure is via social consensus on alternative media.  For
instance, in situations where Bitcoin has failed, whether forking due to
software bugs (as in March 2013), or committing invalid state due to Byzantine
behaviour of miners (as in the July 2016), the well connected community of
businesses, developers, miners, and other organizations established a social
consensus as to what manual actions were required by participants to heal the
network.  Furthermore, since validators of a Tendermint blockchain may be
expected to be identifiable, commitment of an invalid state may even be
punishable by law or some external jurisprudence, if desired.

### TMSP

The Tendermint consensus algorithm is implemented in a program called Tendermint
Core.  Tendermint Core is an application-agnostic "consensus engine" that can
turn any deterministic (blackbox) application into a distributedly replicated
blockchain.  As the Apache Web Server or Nginx connects to the Wordpress
application via CGI or FastCGI, Tendermint Core connects to blockchain
applications via TMSP.

To draw an analogy, lets talk about a well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency blockchain where each node maintains a fully audited
Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) database. If one wanted to create a
Bitcoin-like system on top of TMSP, Tendermint Core would be responsible for

* Sharing blocks and transactions between nodes
* Establishing a canonical/immutable order of transactions (the blockchain)

Meanwhile, application would be responsible for

* Maintaining the UTXO database
* Validating cryptographic signatures of transactions
* Preventing transactions from spending non-existent transactions
* Allowing clients to query the UTXO database.

Tendermint is able to decompose the blockchain design by offering a very simple
API between the application process and consensus process.

TMSP consists of 3 primary message types that get delivered from the core to
the application. The application replies with corresponding response messages.

The `AppendTx` message is the work horse of the application. Each transaction in
the blockchain is delivered with this message. The application needs to validate
each transactions received with the AppendTx message against the current state,
application protocol, and the cryptographic credentials of the transaction. A
validated transaction then needs to update the application state â€” by binding a
value into a key values store, or by updating the UTXO database.

The `CheckTx` message is similar to AppendTx, but itâ€™s only for validating
transactions. Tendermint Coreâ€™s mempool first checks the validity of a
transaction with CheckTx, and only relays valid transactions to its peers.
Applications may check an incrementing nonce in the transaction and return an
error upon CheckTx if the nonce is old.

The `Commit` message is used to compute a cryptographic commitment to the
current application state, to be placed into the next block header. This has
some handy properties. Inconsistencies in updating that state will now appear as
blockchain forks which catches a whole class of programming errors. This also
simplifies the development of secure lightweight clients, as Merkle-hash proofs
can be verified by checking against the block hash, and the block hash is signed
by a quorum of validators.

Additional TMSP messages allow the application to keep track of and change the
validator set, and for the application to receive the block information, such as
the height and the commit votes.  The full TMSP specification can be found
[here](https://github.com/tendermint/tmsp#message-types).

## The GnuClear Hub and Shards #################################################

Here we describe a novel model of decentralization and scalability.  GnuClear is
a network of many blockchains powered by Tendermint via TMSP.  While existing
proposals aim to create a "single blockchain" with total global transaction
ordering, GnuClear permits many blockchains to run concurrently with one another
via a sharding mechanism.

At the basis, a global hub blockchain manages many independent blockchain
shards.  A constant stream of recent block commits from shards posted on the hub
allows the hub to keep up with the state of each shard.  Likewise, each shard
keeps up with the state of the hub (but shards do not keep up with each other
except indirectly through the hub).  Packets of information are then
communicated from one chain to another by posting Merkle-proofs that collide
with a recent block hash from the source.  This mechanism is called
inter-blockchain communication, or IBC for short.

(Diagram of hub and shards)

The blockchain shards can themselves be hubs to form a multi-level hierarchical
network, but for the sake of clarity we will only describe the simple
configuration with one central hub and many shards.

### The GnuClear Hub

The GnuClear hub hosts a multi-asset cryptocurrency, where tokens can be held by
individual users or by shards themselves.  These tokens can be moved from one
shard to another in a special IBC packet called a "coin packet".  The hub is
responsible for preserving the global invariance of the total amount of each
token across the shards.

Since the GnuClear hub acts as a central ledger of tokens for the whole system,
the security of the hub is of paramount importance.  While each shard may be a
Tendermint blockchain that is secured by as few as 4 (or even less if BFT
consensus is not needed), the hub must be secured by a globally decentralized
set of validators that can withstand the most severe attack scenarios, such as a
continental network partition or a nation-state sponsored attack.

### GnuClear Shards

A GnuClear shard is an independent blockchain that exchanges IBC messages with
the Hub.  From the Hub's perspective, a shard is a multi-asset account that can
send and receive tokens using IBC packets. Like an account, a shard cannot send
more tokens than it has, but can receive tokens from others who have them. In
certain cases, a shard may be granted special priveleges to act as a "source" of
some token, where, in addition to the shard's balance in that token, it can send
up to some maximum rate of additional tokens out to other accounts or shards,
thereby inflating that token's supply. Such packets are similar to the "coin"
packet, but have type "issue". Packets of type "issue" for a particular token
may originate from only one shard - that is, there may be only one priveleged
shard per token type.  On Genesis day, a select number of priveleged shards will
be created to act as pegs to other cryptocurrencies. The creation of new
priviledged shards is left to governance.

Note that a shard where +â…” of the validators are Byzantine can commit invalid
state.  Since the very purpose of the GnuClear hub is to avoid verifying every
transaction on a shard, detecting such failures must be done by independent
observers of the shard, which may appeal to social media and to the market to
make their detection known (for instance, selling/shorting a token that is being
artificially inflated by a Byzantine source-shard, and writing a blog post about
the attack).  Additionally, if the validator set of the shard is not the same as
that of the hub, and shard validators have stake bonded on the hub, an explicit
alert mechanism may be used on the hub to challenge the validity of a block and
to slash the deposits of offending validators.

## Inter-blockchain Communication (IBC) ########################################

Now we look at how these independent sovereign blockchains (the hub and shards)
communicate with each other.  Say that there are three blockchains, "Shard1",
"Shard2", and "Hub", and we wish for "Shard1" to produce a packet destined for
"Shard2" going through "Hub". For a packet to move from one blockchain to
another, a proof must be posted on the receiving chain that the sending chain
knows about a packet with the appropriate destination. For the receiving chain
to check the proof, it must keep up with the sender's block headers.  The
mechanism is similar to that used by sidechains, requiring two interacting
chains to "be aware" of one another.

The IBC protocol can therefore naturally be defined using two types of
transaction: an `IBCBlockCommitTx` transaction, which allows a blockchain to
notify another of its most recent block-hash, and an `IBCPacketProofTx`
transaction, which allows a sender blockchain to prove to a receiver blockchain
that a packet destined for the receiver was was included in a recent state of
the sender.  The proof depends on the receiver having received a recent
block-hash via an `IBCBlockCommitTx`.

By splitting the IBC mechanics into two separate transactions `IBCBlockCommitTx`
and `IBCPacketProofTx`, we allow the native fee market-mechanism of the
receiving chain to determine which packets get committed (i.e. acknowledged),
while allowing for complete freedom on the sending chain as to how many outbound
packets are allowed.

![Figure of Shard1, Shard2, and Hub IBC without
acknowledgement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper/master/msc/ibc_without_ack.png)

<CAPTION on a figure>
In the example above, in order to update the block-hash of "Shard1" on "Hub" (or
of "Hub" on "Shard2"), an `IBCBlockCommitTx` transaction must be posted on "Hub"
with the block-hash of "Shard1" (or on "Shard2" with the block-hash of "Hub").

### IBCBlockCommitTx transaction

An `IBCBlockCommitTx` transaction is composed of:
- `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain
- `BlockHash ([]byte)`: The block hash bytes, the Merkle root which includes the
  app-hash
- `BlockPartsHeader (PartSetHeader)`: The block part-set header bytes, only
  needed to verify vote signatures
- `BlockHeight (int)`: The height of the commit
- `BlockRound (int)`: The round of the commit
- `Commit ([]Vote)`: The +â…” Tendermint `Precommit` votes that comprise a block
  commit
- `ValidatorsHash ([]byte)`: A Merkle-tree root hash of the new validator set

### IBCPacketTx transaction

An `IBCPacket` is composed of:
- `Header (IBCPacketHeader)`: The packet header
- `Payload ([]byte)`: The bytes of the packet payload. _Optional_
- `PayloadHash ([]byte)`: The hash for the bytes of the packet. _Optional_

Either one of `Payload` or `PayloadHash` must be present.  The hash of an
`IBCPacket` is a simple Merkle root of the two items, `Header` and `Payload`.
An `IBCPacket` without the full payload is called an _abbreviated packet_.

An `IBCPacketHeader` is composed of:
- `SrcChainID (string)`: The source blockchain ID
- `DstChainID (string)`: The destination blockchain ID
- `Number (int)`: A unique number for all packets
- `Status (enum)`: Can be one of `AckPending`, `AckSent`, `AckReceived`,
  `NoAck`, or `Timeout`
- `Type (string)`: The types are application-dependent.  GnuClear reserves the
  "coin" packet type
- `MaxHeight (int)`: If status is not `NoAckWanted` or `AckReceived` by this
  height, status becomes `Timeout`. _Optional_

An `IBCPacketTx` transaction is composed of:
- `FromChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain which is providing this
  packet; not necessarily the source
- `FromBlockHeight (int)`: The blockchain height in which the following packet
  is included (Merkle-ized) in the block hash of the source chain
- `Packet (IBCPacket)`: A packet of data, whose status may be one of
  `AckPending`, `AckSent`, `AckReceived`, `NoAck`, or `Timeout`
- `PacketProof (IAVLProof)`: A IAVLTree Merkle-proof for proving the packet's
  hash against the `AppHash` of the source chain at given height

The sequence for sending a packet from "Shard1" to "Shard2" through the "Hub" is
depicted in {Figure X}.  First, an `IBCPacketTx` proves to "Hub" that the packet
is included in the app-state of "Shard1".  Then, another `IBCPacketTx` proves to
"Shard2" that the packet is included in the app-state of "Hub".  During this
procedure, the `IBCPacket` fields are identical: the `SrcChainID` is always
"Shard1", and the `DstChainID` is always "Shard2".

The `PacketProof` must have the correct Merkle-proof path, as follows:
``` IBC/<SrcChainID>/<DstChainID>/<Number> ``` TODO: CLARIFY

When "Shard1" wants to send a packet to "Shard2" through "Hub", the `IBCPacket`
data are identical whether the packet is Merkle-ized on "Shard1", the "Hub", or
"Shard2".  The only mutable field is `Status` for tracking delivery, as shown
below.

### IBC Packet Delivery Acknowledgement

There are several reasons why a sender may want the acknowledgement of delivery
of a packet by the receiving chain.  For example, the sender may not know the
status of the destination chain, if it is expected to be faulty.  Or, the sender
may want to impose a timeout on the packet (with the `MaxHeight` packet field),
while any destination chain may suffer from a denial-of-service attack with a
sudden spike in the number of incoming packets.

In these cases, the sender can require delivery acknowledgement by setting the
intial packet status to `AckPending`.  Then, it is the receiving chain's
responsibility to confirm delivery by including an abbreviated`IBCPacket` in the
app Merkle hash.

![Figure of Shard1, Shard2, and Hub IBC with
acknowledgement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper/master/msc/ibc_with_ack.png)

First, an `IBCBlockCommit` and `IBCPacketTx` are posted on "Hub" that proves the
existence of an `IBCPacket` on "Shard1".  Say that `IBCPacketTx` has the
following value:
- `FromChainID`: "Shard1"
- `FromBlockHeight`: 100 (say)
- `Packet`: an `IBCPacket`:
  - `Header`: an `IBCPacketHeader`:
    - `SrcChainID`: "Shard1"
    - `DstChainID`: "Shard2"
    - `Number`: 200 (say)
    - `Status`: `AckPending`
    - `Type`: "coin"
    - `MaxHeight`: 350 (say "Hub" is currently at height 300)
  - `Payload`: &lt;The bytes of a "coin" payload&gt;

Next, an `IBCBlockCommit` and `IBCPacketTx` are posted on "Shard2" that proves
the existence of an `IBCPacket` on "Hub".  Say that `IBCPacketTx` has the
following value:
- `FromChainID`: "Hub"
- `FromBlockHeight`: 300
- `Packet`: an `IBCPacket`:
  - `Header`: an `IBCPacketHeader`:
    - `SrcChainID`: "Shard1"
    - `DstChainID`: "Shard2"
    - `Number`: 200
    - `Status`: `AckPending`
    - `Type`: "coin"
    - `MaxHeight`: 350
  - `Payload`: &lt;The same bytes of a "coin" payload&gt;

Next, "Shard2" must include in its app-hash an abbreviated packet that shows the
new status of `AckSent`.  An `IBCBlockCommit` and `IBCPacketTx` are posted back
on "Hub" that proves the existence of an abbreviated `IBCPacket` on "Shard2".
Say that `IBCPacketTx` has the following value:
- `FromChainID`: "Shard2"
- `FromBlockHeight`: 400 (say)
- `Packet`: an `IBCPacket`:
  - `Header`: an `IBCPacketHeader`:
    - `SrcChainID`: "Shard1"
    - `DstChainID`: "Shard2"
    - `Number`: 200
    - `Status`: `AckSent`
    - `Type`: "coin"
    - `MaxHeight`: 350
  - `PayloadHash`: &lt;The hash bytes of the same "coin" payload&gt;

Finally, "Hub" must update the status of the packet from `AckPending` to
`AckReceived`.  Evidence of this new finalized status should go back to
"Shard2".  Say that `IBCPacketTx` has the following value:
- `FromChainID`: "Hub"
- `FromBlockHeight`: 301
- `Packet`: an `IBCPacket`:
  - `Header`: an `IBCPacketHeader`:
    - `SrcChainID`: "Shard1"
    - `DstChainID`: "Shard2"
    - `Number`: 200
    - `Status`: `AckReceived`
    - `Type`: "coin"
    - `MaxHeight`: 350
  - `PayloadHash`: &lt;The hash bytes of the same "coin" payload&gt;

Meanwhile, "Shard1" may optimistically assume successful delivery of a "coin"
packet unless evidence to the contrary is proven on "Hub".  In the example
above, if "Hub" had not received an `AckSent` status from "Shard2" by block 350,
it would have set the status automatically to `Timeout`.  This evidence of a
timeout can get posted back on "Shard1", and any coins can be returned.

## Use Cases ###################################################################

### Pegging to Other Cryptocurrencies

A priveleged shard can act as the source of a pegged token of another
cryptocurrency. A peg is in essence similar to the relationship between a
GnuClear hub and shard, in that both must keep up with the latest blocks of the
other in order to verify proofs that tokens have moved from one to the other.  A
peg-shard on the GnuClear network keeps up with both the hub as well as the
other cryptocurrency.  The indirection through the peg-shard allows the logic of
the hub to remain simple by encapsulating any non-Tendermint consensus
light-client verification logic onto the shard.

For instance, a GnuClear shard with some validator set, possibly the same as
that of the hub, could act as an ether-peg, where the TMSP-application on the
shard (the "peg-shard") has mechanisms to exchange IBC messages with a
peg-contract on the external Ethereum blockchain (the "target").  This contract
would allow ether holders to send ether to the peg-shard by sending it to the
peg-contract on Ethereum.  Once ether is received by the peg-contract, the ether
cannot be withdrawn unless an appropriate IBC packet is received by the
peg-contract from the peg-shard. When a peg-shard receives an IBC packet proving
that ether was received in the peg-contract for a particular Ethereum account, a
corresponding account is created on the peg-shard with that balance.  Ether on
the peg-shard ("pegged-ether") can then be transferred to and from the hub, and
later be destroyed with a transaction that sends it to a particular withdrawal
address on Ethereum; an IBC packet proving that the transaction occured on the
peg-shard can be posted to the Ethereum peg-contract to allow the ether to be
withdrawn. 

Of course, the risk of such a pegging contract is a rogue validator set.  â…“+
Byzantine validators could cause a fork, withdrawing ether from the peg-contract
on Ethereum while keeping the pegged-ether on the peg-shard. Worse, +â…”
Byzantine validators can steal ether outright from those who sent it to the
peg-contract by deviating from the original pegging logic of the peg-shard.

It is possible to address these issues by designing the peg to be "totally
accountable".  For example, all IBC packets both from the hub as well as from
the target might require acknowledgement by the peg-shard in such a way that all
state transitions of the peg-shard can be efficiently challenged and verified by
either the hub or the target.  The hub and the target (or in the case of
Ethereum, the peg-contract) should allow the peg-shard validators to post
collateral, and coin transfers out of the peg-contract should be delayed (and
collateral unbonding period sufficiently long) to allow for any challenges to be
made.  We leave the design of the specification and implementation of this
system open as a future GnuClear improvement proposal.

While the socio-political atmosphere is not quite evolved enough yet, we can
extend the mechanism to allow for shards which peg to the fiat currency of a
nation states by forming a validator set out of some combination of institutions
responsible for the nation's currency, most particularly, its banks. Of course,
extra precautions must be made to only accept currencies backed by strong legal
systems that can enforce auditability of the banks' activities by a sufficiently
large group of trusted notaries and institutions.

A result of this integration would be, for instance, the ability of anyone with
a bank account at a participating bank to move dollars from their bank account,
which is on the shard, to other accounts on the shard, or to the hub, or to
another shard entirely.  In this regard, GnuClear can act as a seamless conduit
between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.

### Ethereum Scaling

An open issue for Ethereum is how to solve the scaling problem.  Currently,
Ethereum nodes process every single transaction and also stores all the state.
[link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CjD0W4l4-CwHKUvfF5Vlps76fKLEC6pIwu1a_kC_YRQ/mobilepresent?slide=id.gd284b9333_0_28).

Since Tendermint can commit blocks much faster than Ethereum's proof-of-work,
EVM shards powered by Tendermint consensus and operating on pegged-ether can
provide higher performance to Ethereum blockchains.  Additionally, though the
GnuClear hub and IBC packet mechanics does not allow for arbitrary contract
logic execution per se, it can be used to co-ordinate Ethereum contracts running
on different shards, providing a foundation for generalized Ethereum scaling via
sharding.  For example, asynchronous contract calls that "send an action" and
expect a response in return could be implemented by a sequence of two IBC
packets going in opposite directions.

### Multi-Application Integration

GnuClear shards run arbitrary application logic, defined at the beginning of the
shard's life, and potentially updated over time by governance. Such flexibility
allows GnuClear shards to act as pegs to other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum
or Bitcoin, but it also permits "forks" of those blockchains, utilizing the same
codebase but a different validator set and history. This allows many existing
cryptocurrency frameworks, such as that of Ethereum, ZCash, Bitcoin, CryptoNote,
and so on to be used with a higher performance consensus engine on a common
network, openning tremendous opportunity for interoperability across platforms.
Furthermore, as a multi-asset blockchain, a single transaction may contain
multiple inputs and outputs, where each input can be any token type, enabling
GnuClear to serve directly as a platform for decentralized exchange, though
orders are assumed to be matched via other platforms. Alternatively, a shard can
serve as an exchange, including hosting the orderbook, openning up new business
opportunities for blockchain backed exchanges, which may themselves trade
liquidity over the GnuClear network.

Shards can also serve as blockchain-backed versions of enterprise and government
systems, where pieces of a particular service, traditionally run by an
organization or group of organizations, are instead run as a TMSP application on
a certain shard, allowing it to inherit the security and interoperability of the
public GnuClear network, without sacrificing control over the underlying
service.  Thus, GnuClear may be a best of both worlds for organizations looking
to utilize blockchain technology that are wary of relinquishing control to an
unidentified set of miners.

### Network Partition Mitigation

A major problem with consistency favouring consensus algorithms like Tendermint
is thought to be that any network partition which causes there to be no single
partition with +â…” validators will halt consensus altogether. The GnuClear
architecture can mitigate this problem by using a global hub with regional
autonomous shards, where +â…” validators in a shard are based in a common
geographic region. For instance, a common paradigm may be for individual cities,
or local clusters of them, to operate a given shard for the coordination of
finances and infrastructure, enabling municipal activity to persist in the event
that otherwise remote service providers fail. 

## Issuance and Incentives #####################################################

### The Gnut Token

While the GnuClear hub is a multi-asset system, there is a native coin for
staking called _gnuts_.  Unlike Ethereum's ether or Bitcoin's bitcoins,
GnuClear's gnuts are meant for staking by validators.  To discourage the use of
gnuts as a store-of-wealth or means of exchange, gnuts that are not held in bond
decay with a half-life of 5 years (PARAM).  Gnut holders who do not wish to
validate, or cannot because they do not meet the bonding threshold (PARAM) can
delegate to any of the existing validators.  Gnut holders who delegate to
validators do not pay the decay penalty.

### Number of Validators

Unlike Bitcoin or other proof-of-work blockchains, a Tendermint blockchain gets
slower with more validators due to the increased communication complexity.
Fortunately, we can support enough validators to make for a robust globally
distributed blockchain with very fast blocktimes, and, as bandwidth, storage,
and parallel compute capacity increases, we will be able to support more
validators in the future.

On genesis day, the maximum number of validators will be set to 100, and this
number will increase at a rate of 13% for 10 years, and settle at 300
validators.  

``` 
Year 0: 100
Year 1: 113
Year 2: 127
Year 3: 144
Year 4: 163
Year 5: 184
Year 6: 208
Year 7: 235
Year 8: 265
Year 9: 300
```

### Becoming a Validator

New validators can be added in a two-step process.

First, the would-be validator must post a bond-proposal and post a collateral
deposit.  The amount of gnuts posted as collateral is what determines the
validator's voting power.

Second, the rest of the validators must vote on this proposal.  If more than Â½
of the gnu-holders vote yes, the proposal passes, and the candidate becomes a
validator at the specified block height.

Given the same amount of usage of the GnuClear network, the validators may not
have a natural inclination to allow more gnut holders to bond, because this
decreases the amount of fees earned by each validator.  Yet, the network might
become more profitable if there were more collateral at stake, as it allows for
more transaction velocity. In that case, it might be rational for validators to
allow a new gnut holder to bond, as long as it brings more stake to the table.
Thus, bond proposals can also include any number of non-gnu tokens as
collateral. These tokens join the blockchain's token reserve pool.

``` 
BondProposal 
	BonderAddr   []byte 
	Coins        // Gnuts and other coins
	StartHeight  int 
```

### Penalties for Validators

There must be some penalty imposed on the validators for when they intentionally
or unintentionally deviate from the sanctioned protocol. Some evidence is
immediately admissible, such as a double-sign at the same height and round, or a
violation of "prevote-the-lock" (a violation of the Tendermint consensus
protocol).  Such evidence will result in the validator losing its good standing
and its bonded gnu tokens as well its proportionate share of tokens from the
reserve pool will get slashed.

Sometimes, validators will not be available, either due to regional network
disruptions, power failure, or other reasons.  If, at any point in the past
`ValidatorTimeoutWindow` blocks, a validator's commit vote is not included in
the blockchain more than `ValidatorTimeoutMaxAbsent` times, that validator will
become inactive, and lose 5% of its stake.  Its stake will remain bonded for
`UnbondingPeriod` blocks.

Some "malicious" behavior do not produce obviously discernable evidence on the
blockchain. In these cases, the validators can coordinate out of band to force
the timeout of a validator.

In situations where the GnuClear hub halts due to a â…“+ coalition of validators
going offline, or in situations where a â…“+ coalition of validators censor
evidence of malicious behavior from entering the blockchain, as long as there
are -Â½ such Byzantine validators, the hub will recover with a reorg-proposal.
(Link to "Forks and Censorship Attacks").

### Transaction Fees

GnuClear validators can accept any token type or combination of types as a fee
for processing a transaction.  Each validator can subjectively set whatever
exchange rate it wants, and choose whatever transactions it wants, as long as
the `BlockGasLimit` is not exceeded.  The collected fees are redistributed to
the holders of bonded gnu tokens, proportionately, every `ValidatorPayoutPeriod`
blocks.

### Initial Distribution

The initial distribution of gnut coins and validators on Genesis day is ...

TODO

### Genesis Validator Vesting

Validators on genesis day will be incentivized to continue validating, by virtue
of a vesting schedule.  All of the initial bonded gnuts of the validators on
genesis day will vest at a rate of 10% a year, per block.  Vesting gnuts can be
used to the full extent for voting, but disappears after unbonding.  It follows
that vesting gnuts cannot be transferred.
